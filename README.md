**Introduction**                                                                          
Image steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within an image.
It is a form of covert communication that allows for the hiding of secret data within an innocuous image.

**Purpose** 
To conceal the existence of the hidden data, making it invisible.

**Methods** 

1. Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion:
Embeds secret data by altering the least significant bits of pixel values,
making changes imperceptible to the human eye.

2.Transform Domain Techniques (TDT):
Hides data within the frequency domain of the image (e.g., using DCT or DWT), providing better robustness against common image processing operations.
